Project Summary:
In this project, we analyzed the messy FIFA 21 dataset to gain insights into player attributes and values. We performed data cleaning by converting height and weight columns to numerical forms, removing newline characters, and handling special characters in value, wage, and release clause columns. Additionally, we calculated the years each player has been at their current club based on the 'Joined' column.

We visualized the relationship between player wages and values using a scatter plot, identifying players who are highly valuable but receive relatively low wages. By converting star columns into numerical values, we further enriched our analysis.

Overall, this project demonstrates the data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization techniques applied to explore player data from FIFA 21, providing valuable insights into player attributes and compensation.
